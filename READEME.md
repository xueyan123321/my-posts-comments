# My Readable project

This is my final assignment project for Udacity's React & Redux. All functionalities are verified by me. I focus on the javescript to process the interacity aspect and use a very famous UI framework called [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) in China. I use a lot of UI components in that library and
also use react-redux and react-router.

## INSTALLITION

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start

Then the app will be served in http://localhost:3000
